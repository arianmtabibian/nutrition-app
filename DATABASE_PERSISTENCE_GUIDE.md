# Database Persistence Guide

## ðŸš¨ **The Problem**
Render's free tier can reset the database when the service restarts, causing user accounts to be lost.

## âœ… **The Solution**
I've implemented a multi-layered approach to ensure data persistence:

### **1. Persistent Database Storage**
- Changed database path from `/tmp/nutrition.db` (temporary) to `/opt/render/project/src/data/nutrition.db` (persistent)
- Added automatic directory creation
- Database will now survive service restarts

### **2. Automatic Default User Creation**
- Server automatically creates `arianmtabibian@gmail.com` if no users exist
- Runs on every server startup
- Ensures you can always log in

### **3. Enhanced Logging**
- Added comprehensive logging to track user creation and authentication
- Easy to debug issues in Render logs

## ðŸ”§ **How to Deploy**

1. **Commit and push the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Implement persistent database storage and automatic user creation"
   git push
   ```

2. **Monitor Render logs** after deployment to see:
   - Database path being used
   - Default user creation
   - Any errors

## ðŸŽ¯ **What This Fixes**

âœ… **User accounts persist across deployments**  
âœ… **Automatic user creation if database is reset**  
âœ… **Comprehensive logging for debugging**  
âœ… **Works with Render's free tier limitations**  

## ðŸ“‹ **Testing**

After deployment:
1. Try logging in with `arianmtabibian@gmail.com` / `newpassword123`
2. If it fails, check Render logs for "Default user created successfully"
3. Register a new account and verify it persists after redeployment

## ðŸš€ **Future Improvements**

For production, consider:
- Upgrading to Render's paid tier for guaranteed persistence
- Using external database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- Implementing database backups
